Provide a script which could compare the results generated by two different methods. 
There are two files generated by two different methods respectively with the same format. Each row indicates a DNA sequence match between 2 samples, where the 2nd column and 3rd column are sample ID, the 4th / 5th column are the "start point" / "end point" for the matched sequence, and the last column is the total length (5th column -4th column). Please count the results shared by two files (Same pair of samples and same position). Note: if 90% sequence is shared by the same pair of samples in two files, it should be counted as a shared result. Coding Language: Python or R
