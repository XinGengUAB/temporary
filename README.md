Compare the results generated by two different methods. 
There are two files generated by two methods respectively with the same format. Each row indicates a sequence match between 2 samples, where the 2nd column and 3rd column are sample ID, the 4th and 5th column are the "start point" and "end point" for the matched sequence, and the last column is the total length (5th column -4th column). Please count the results (row) which are shared by two files. Note: if 90% sequence is shared by another file, it should be counted as a shared result.
